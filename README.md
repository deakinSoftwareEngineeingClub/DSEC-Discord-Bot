### Why Rust?

This is a good opportunity for students at Deakin to learn Rust.

Rust is memory safe yet performant, making it the ideal programming language for systems programming. At Deakin, Software Engineering, Computer Science and IT students mostly touch high level languages such as Python, C# and low level languages such as C++.

More and more developer tools are being written in Rust, including Rolldown, Rspack, Tauri, SWC and many more (I'm a web developer, I'm only aware of these tools written in Rust).

Rust has its own unique concepts and challenges such as the ownership model and the borrow checker. Its strict rules help prevent programming errors such as data races and memory leaks. The strict rules also help students learn how to think about writing efficient code coming from high level languages.
